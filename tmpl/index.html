		## Custom CSS

		Browser Plugin provide a possibilities to change where overlay parts will placed via CSS.

		There is a main classes that you can change:
		- `.standings`
		- `.relatives`
		- `.car` (fuel level, etc...)
		- `.tyres`
		- `.twitch`

		Some examples:

		1. To hide any part of overlay:
		   ```css
		   .relatives {
		   	display: none;
		   }
		   ```
		   Now you will never see `relatives` box in overlay.

		2. Stick `standings` to the top of the screen:
		   ```css
		   .standings {
		   	top: 0px;
		   }
		   ```
		   There I say, place my `standings` with `0px` gap from the top.

		   And to the bottom of the screen:
		   ```css
		   .standings {
		   	top: inherit;
		   	bottom: 0px;
		   }
		   ```
		   Use `left: 20px;` to move standings horizontally

		   **Never use `right` option, or your standings will jump everytime someone get offtrack**

		3. Place twitch viewers/followers counter to the left bottom corner with `12px` gap:
		   ```css
		   .twitch > .counters {
		   	left: 12px;
		   	right: inherit;
		   	bottom: 12px;
		   }
		   ```
		   `right: inherit;` will remove default value.

		4. Make `relatives` background half transparent
		   ```css
		   .relatives {
		   	background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.67);
		   }
		   ```
